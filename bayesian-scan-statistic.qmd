Public health surveillance 
: The systematic, ongoing assessment of the health of a community including the timely collection, analysis, interpretation, dissemination and subsequent use of data. [^1]

[^1]: Teutsch, Steven M. and Churchill, R. Elliott "Principles and practice of public health surveillance"  (1992)

## Motivation

A subset of disease surveillance methods focus on disease progression and outbreak detection.

:::{.callout-warning}
## Novel disease monitoring

New diseases often lack reliable testing and reporting systems. Early cases may be missed or misclassified, obscuring disease surgeillance techniques that assume complete cases.

Examples

- COVID-19
- HIV/AIDS
- Tuberculosis (TB)

# Spatial Scan Statistics

## General Concept

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width='50%}

Scan statistics

1. Select candidate regions
2. calculate relative risk inside and outside of candidate region
3. Determine region with largest risk ratio

## Frequentist Spatial Scan Statistic

- Likelihood ratio test
- Monte-Carlo simulation to determine test statistic distribution

## Bayesian Spatial Scan Statistics

## Bayesian Interpretation

table: Interpretation of Bayes factor[^2]

| BF        | Log(BF)      | Strength of evidence $H_0$ |
|:----------|:-------------|:---------------------------|
| 1 to 3.2  | 0 to 1.16    | Not Significcant           |
| 3.2 to 10 | 1.16 to 2.30 | Positive                   |
| 10 to 100 | 2.30 to 4.61 | Strong                     |
| $>$ 100   | $> 4.61$     | Decisive                   |

# Proposed method

## Accounting for Under-reporting
