	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic that began at the end of 2019 has caused hundreds of millions of infections and millions of deaths worldwide. COVID-19 posed a threat to human health and profoundly impacted the global economy and people’s lifestyles. The United States is one of the countries severely affected by the disease. Evidence shows that the spread of COVID-19 was significantly underestimated in the early stages, which prevented governments from adopting effective interventions promptly to curb the spread of the disease. This paper adopts a Bayesian hierarchical model to study the under-reporting of COVID-19 at the state level in the United States as of the end of April 2020. The model examines the effects of different covariates on the under-reporting and accurate incidence rates and considers spatial dependency. In addition to under-reporting (false negatives), we also explore the impact of over-reporting (false positives). Adjusting for misclassification requires adding additional parameters that are not directly identified by the observed data. Informative priors are required. We discuss prior elicitation and include R functions that convert expert information into the appropriate prior distribution.},

	doi = {10.1109/ICDM.2011.11},
	abstract = {We present Generalized Fast Subset Sums (GFSS), a new Bayesian framework for scalable and accurate detection of irregularly shaped spatial clusters using multiple data streams. GFSS extends the previously proposed Multivariate Bayesian Scan Statistic (MBSS) and Fast Subset Sums (FSS) approaches for detection of emerging events. The detection power of MBSS is primarily limited by computational considerations, which limit it to searching over circular spatial regions. GFSS enables more accurate and timely detection by defining a hierarchical prior over all subsets of the N locations, first selecting a local neighborhood consisting of a center location and its neighbors, and introducing a sparsity parameter p to describe how likely each location in the neighborhood is to be affected. This approach allows us to consider all possible subsets of locations (including irregularly-shaped regions) but also puts higher weight on more compact regions. We demonstrate that MBSS and FSS are both special cases of this general framework (assuming p = 1 and p = 0.5 respectively), but substantially higher detection power can be achieved by choosing an appropriate value of p. Thus we show that the distribution of the sparsity parameter p can be accurately learned from a small number of labeled events. Our evaluation results (on synthetic disease outbreaks injected into real-world hospital data) show that the GFSS method with learned sparsity parameter has higher detection power and spatial accuracy than MBSS and FSS, particularly when the affected region is irregular or elongated. We also show that the learned models can be used for event characterization, accurately distinguishing between two otherwise identical event types based on the sparsity of the affected spatial region.},

	abstract = {In this chapter we describe Bayesian scan statistics, a class of methods which build both on the prior literature on scan statistics and on Bayesian approaches to cluster detection and modeling. We first compare and contrast the Bayesian scan to the traditional, frequentist hypothesis testing approach to scan statistics and summarize the advantages and disadvantages of each approach. We then focus on three different Bayesian scan statistic approaches: the Bayesian variable window scan statistic, the multivariate Bayesian scan statistic and extensions, and scan statistic approaches based on Bayesian networks. We describe each of these approaches in detail and compare these to related Bayesian scan methods and to the wider literature on Bayesian cluster detection and modeling. Finally, we discuss several promising areas for future work in Bayesian scan statistics, including multiple cluster detection, nonparametric Bayesian approaches, extension of Bayesian spatial scan to nonspatial datasets, and computationally efficient methods for model learning and detection.},

	abstract = {In disease surveillance, there are often many different data sets or data groupings for which we wish to do surveillance. If each data set is analysed separately rather than combined, the statistical power to detect an outbreak that is present in all data sets may suffer due to low numbers in each. On the other hand, if the data sets are added by taking the sum of the counts, then a signal that is primarily present in one data set may be hidden due to random noise in the other data sets. In this paper, we present an extension of the spatial and space–time scan statistic that simultaneously incorporates multiple data sets into a single likelihood function, so that a signal is generated whether it occurs in only one or in multiple data sets. This is done by defining the combined log likelihood as the sum of the individual log likelihoods for those data sets for which the observed case count is more than the expected. We also present another extension, where the concept of combining likelihoods from different data sets is used to adjust for covariates. Using data from the National Bioterrorism Syndromic Surveillance Demonstration Project, we illustrate the new method using physician telephone calls, regular physician visits and urgent care visits by Harvard Pilgrim Health Care members cared for by Harvard Vanguard Medical Associates, a large multi-specialty group practice in Massachusetts. For upper and lower gastrointestinal (GI) illness, there were on average 20 telephone calls, nine urgent care visits and 22 regular physician visits per day. The strongest signal was generated by a single data set and due to a familial outbreak of pinworm disease. The second and third strongest signals were generated by the combined strength of two of the three data sets. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The main interest is in detecting clusters not explained by the baseline process. These methods are illustrated on an epidemiological data set, but there are other potential areas of application as well.},

These normalizing constants are notoriously diﬃcult to obtain, as they usually involve highdimensional integrals that cannot be solved analytically. Here we introduce an R package that uses bridge sampling (Meng and Wong 1996; Meng and Schilling 2002) to estimate normalizing constants in a generic and easy-to-use fashion. For models implemented in Stan, the estimation procedure is automatic. We illustrate the functionality of the package with three examples.},
